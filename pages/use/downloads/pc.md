</div>

The application is distributed as a Windows Installer package. Simply run the installer and select an install location. Once the installation is complete, you should see the OpenHome Player icon on your desktop. Double-click the icon to start the player; the application will run in as a 'system tray' task.

To stream audio to the Player, use your OpenHome controller (eg Linn Kazoo or Bubble DS) to find your Player on the network. The player will use the same name as the PC it is running on. Select the Player as the current renderer, choose some tracks to play and you're ready to go!
