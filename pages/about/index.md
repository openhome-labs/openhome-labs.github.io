> OpenHome - The Open Platform for networked digital audio streaming.

OpenHome is an Open Standard for leading edge streaming digital audio, providing an advanced feature set for networked home audio devices. Interoperability with other devices is a key aspect, and OpenHome delivers by providing complete reference implementations and interoperability certification to ensure that OpenHome compatible players work seamlessly to bring you high quality audio throughout the home.

## Raising the Standard

Our goal is to make high quality streaming audio ubiquitous. We believe that can only happen with a spirit of openness and cooperation in order to achieve true seamless interaction across devices and manufacturers. So how do we acheive that?  We take OpenHome - a mature and proven digtal audio platform - and make it OpenSource. We all benefit from a well designed set of services based on UPnP, plus a __complete implementation__ of Renderer and Control Point stacks, combined with conformance testing to ensure that end users get the high quality, seamless interaction they desire.

To find out more about the OpenHome organisation, check out our [Openhome.org](/pages/about/org.html) page, or if you'd like to know more about the OpenHome platform then go to the [OpenHome Platform](/pages/platform.html) section.

Our [Openhome Labs](/pages/services/index.html) gives you information about the products and services we provide to help you get your OpenHome products to market.
