OpenHome is a feature-rich network audio streaming platform, with a host of configuration and tunign options making it easy to integrate into any device.

The OpenHome codebase is inherently cross-platform and has been developed in portable C++. It has been ported to a number of architectures including x86, ARM, MIPS and to various embedded, RTOS and desktop OSs.
